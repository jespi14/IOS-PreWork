## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: CARROT
- Very Smooth Interface
- Rather than it just a weather app, it has some fun features such as changing the personality of the weather app and finding landmarks
- Good implementation on the Apple Watch as well

App: Lose it!
- Has data like my fitness pal but is laid out in a very pleasing way
- Can be personalized to have themes that fit the user

App: Heart Watch
- Has more data than the Activity App and it laid out for more information
- The contrasting colors are very appealing  while looking at your data

IDEA
To design a budget app that is simple but has a lot of data along with a very good-looking interface. Most budget apps require that you link up a bank account which can make the app very accurate but this requires constant verification to keep the accurate and this gives someone your bank account information, which is not optimal. It can also make the app very slow because of the syncing especially if you have different bank accounts. With this app, we want budgeting to be simple and aesthetically pleasing like the listed apps. A lot of the time users want simple, beautiful, and smooth apps. While this might not be innovative like other apps, it is an app that can not be found currently in the app store. 

## Notes
Coding the logic was not very hard but ensuring that the code and the UI talk to each other and perform how they are intended is the hard part. It requires understanding when to call functions at certain times. A lot of the time students will learn how to code and the syntax but this is only  part of the work. The other half of it gets all the input buttons and layout to seamlessly work together and make it visually pleasing.
