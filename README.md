## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: CARROT
- Very Smooth Inteface
- Rather than it just a weather app, has some fun features such as changing the personality of the weather app and finding landmarks
- Good implementation on the Apple Watch as well

App: Lose it!
- Has data like my fitness pal but is layed out in a very pleasing way
- Can be personalized to have themes that fit the user

App: Heart Watch
- Has more data than the Activity App and it layed out for more information
- The contrasting colors are very appealing  while looking at your data

IDEA
To design a budget app that is simple but has alot of data along with a very good looking interface. Most budget apps require that you link up bank account which can make the app very accurate but this requires constant reverfication to keep the accurate and this gives someone your bank account information, which is not optiumal. It can also make the app very slow because of the syncing espesically if you have different bank accounts. With this app, we want budgeting to be simple and very aesthetically pleasing like the listed apps. Alot of the time user just want simple, beautiful and smooth apps. While this might not be innovatiave like other apps, it is an app that can not be found currently in the app store. 

## Notes
Coding the logic was not very hard but ensuring that the code and the UI talk to each other and perform how they are intended is the hard part. It requires understand when to call function certain times. Alot of the time students will learn how to code and the syntax but this is only  part of the work. The other half of it getting all the input buttons and layout all to seemlessly work together and make it visually pleasing.
